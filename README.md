2. Repo should include a folder called assets which should have a subfolder for all images and a subfolder for css files.

3. Repo should include the use of Meyerweb reset to make sure pages are acceptable for various browsers.

4. Repo should be updated using basic Git commands in the command terminal - files may not be manually uploaded to GitHub (git status, git add, git commit and git push).
